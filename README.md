Six different algorithms were implemented: 
Genetic, Greedy, Nearest Neighbour, Simulated Annealing, Random Swapping, and Ant colony Optimisation. 

All implementations were coded in Rust.

They were then tested in a map of a random number of cities that were randomly positioned.
5 minutes were given for all the iterative algorithms.

Here were the results:
The mean ratios for distance / one-tree go as follows (closer to one is better): 

Genetic                   1.12547

Greedy Heuristic          1.25549

Nearest Neighbour         1.30237

Simulated Annealing       1.33065

Random Swapping           1.44725

Ant colony Optimisation   1.58841
